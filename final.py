#second function will access and store at least 100 items in your database from each API/website in at least one table per API/website. 
# For at least one API you must have two tables that share a key
# You must not have duplicate data in your database!  Do not split data from one table into two! 
# Also, there should be only one database! 
#third function will limit how much data you store from an API into the database each time you execute your code to 25 or fewer items 
# The data must be stored in a SQLite database. This meansthat you must run the code that stores the data multiple times 
# to gather at least 100 items total without duplicating existing data or changing it.
#then we process the data- 3 functions
#first function is selecting some data from all of the tables in your database and calculate something from that data
#example for first function: Calculating # of hm items occur on a particular day of the week
#  or the average of the number of items per day.  
#second function: You must do at least one database jointo select your data
#third function: Write out the calculated data to a file as text
#Next step: at least 3 visualizations, different from what we did in lecture, maybe 2 more visualizations for extra credit
